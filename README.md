Data set-02
This is dataset which is used to recommend the crop for the suitable soil. This will be very useful in crop production (Agriculture) without loses based on soil ph, rainfall, humidity and other chemical components present in the soil.

Nitrogen (N) is so vital because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound by which plants use sunlight energy to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide (i.e., photosynthesis). It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without proteins, plants wither and die.

Phosphorus (P) is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.

Potassium (K) is a critical nutrient that plants absorb from the soil, and from fertilizer. It increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter.

The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75F. These values are favorable for normal life functions of earth biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism.

The pH range 5.5–6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.

Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest.
